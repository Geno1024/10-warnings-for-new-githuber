# 10 Warnings For New GitHuber

Actually, more than 10, maybe.

1. My GitHub Pages reported 404.
	Wait for 10 minutes.
	Check your email.

2. I want to get updates from fork base.
	You can see a sentence "This branch is ? commit(s) before..." in a blue box on the top of the file list in your repo page, with a "Pull Request" in the right. Use it, create a pull request from the fork source(which is called upstream) to your repo.
